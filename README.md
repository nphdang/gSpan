# gSpan
gSpan, an efficient algorithm for mining frequent subgraphs

# How to run
1. Download and install .NET Framework 4.0 (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17718).
2. Run the program.
3. Click Browse to select a graph dataset.
4. Specify the minimum support threshold (minSup).
5. Click "Mine data" to discover frequent subgraphs.
6. The result includes # of frequent subgraphs and runtime (in seconds).
